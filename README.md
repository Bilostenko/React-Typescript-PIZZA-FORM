# Pizza Manager

Pizza Manager is a React and TypeScript application that allows users to add, edit, and delete pizza entries. This project is designed to help you practice and understand the features of TypeScript in a real-world application.

## Features

- **Delete Pizza**: Click the "Delete" label on the pizza card to remove the pizza from the list.
